Your stomach lining is not designed to consume highly processed ingredients. This then results in it becoming damaged and leaking, boosting inflammation and breakouts.</p><ul><li>Debloat your face and skin from inflammation with ease, in the care of your home or even when you’re on the go.</li><li>We understand life gets in the way; this is why with Velutra you do not need to take any drastic diet or lifestyle changes to start seeing results.</li><li>No need for a 7 day water fast, no need to cut sugar or carbohydrates out of your diet. No need for the impractical. </li><li>The Velutra formula is densely packed with all the right stuff and no additives. </li></ul>",
